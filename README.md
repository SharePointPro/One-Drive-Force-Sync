# One-Drive-Force-Sync
Small app to force a SharePoint Document Library & One Drive to sync on click. Fixing the issue of SharePoint Document Libraries slow sync time.

I found that SharePoint Document libraries synced with One Drive with a large amount of files was not triggering a sync instantly after a file was added or edited on the Document Library.
This was an issue for some clients.

I noticed that the problem was intermittent, on occasion it would sync instantly, other times it would take upto 20 minutes for files to come down to one drive once.

This simple app forces a sync when it is executed. The app can be pined to the taskbar and easily executed when a instant sync is required.

# Installation From Binary
Run setup.exe
This will install the application to "C:\Program Files (x86)\DevPoint\Force Sync" and create a shortcut on the desktop
Run the ForceSync Settings Shortcut.
Enter all the document libraries you wish to force sync. (One click will force all document libraries run a sync, any number of document libraires can be added)
Another short cut is added to the Desktop, "OnedriveForceSync" pin this to your taskbar. 
Click "OneDiveForceSync" anytim you want your document libraires to be sycned
